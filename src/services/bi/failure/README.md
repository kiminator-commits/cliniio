# BI Failure Service Modularization

This document outlines the refactoring of the `biFailureService.ts` (546 lines) into focused, modular services following the established patterns in the codebase.

## Overview

The original `biFailureService.ts` was a monolithic service that handled multiple responsibilities:

- Incident CRUD operations
- Workflow management
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Regulatory notifications
- Analytics and reporting
- Patient exposure tracking

## Refactored Structure

The service has been decomposed into focused, single-responsibility services:

```
services/bi/failure/
├── index.ts                           # Main orchestrator (maintains backward compatibility)
├── BIFailureErrorHandler.ts           # Centralized error handling (200 lines)
├── BIFailureValidationService.ts      # Input validation and business rules (350 lines)
├── BIFailureIncidentService.ts        # Incident CRUD operations (300 lines)
├── BIFailureWorkflowService.ts        # Resolution workflow management (350 lines)
├── BIFailureNotificationService.ts    # Regulatory notifications (400 lines)
└── BIFailureAnalyticsService.ts       # Analytics and reporting (450 lines)
```

## Service Responsibilities

### 1. BIFailureErrorHandler.ts

- **Purpose**: Centralized error handling and retry logic
- **Key Features**:
  - Custom error types (`BIFailureError`, `PatientExposureError`)
  - Retry wrapper with exponential backoff
  - Database error classification
  - Error severity assessment
  - Error logging and formatting

### 2. BIFailureValidationService.ts

- **Purpose**: Input validation and business rules
- **Key Features**:
  - Parameter validation for all operations
  - Business rule enforcement
  - UUID format validation
  - Date range validation
  - Input sanitization

### 3. BIFailureIncidentService.ts

- **Purpose**: Incident CRUD operations
- **Key Features**:
  - Create, read, update, delete incidents
  - Incident status management
  - Incident history tracking
  - Exposure window tool identification
  - Facility-specific operations

### 4. BIFailureWorkflowService.ts

- **Purpose**: Resolution workflow management
- **Key Features**:
  - Tool quarantine operations
  - Workflow step management
  - Patient exposure tracking
  - Tool validation
  - Real-time subscriptions

### 5. BIFailureNotificationService.ts

- **Purpose**: Regulatory notifications and alerts
- **Key Features**:
  - Regulatory notification sending
  - Internal notification management
  - Escalation workflows
  - Notification scheduling
  - Retry mechanisms

### 6. BIFailureAnalyticsService.ts

- **Purpose**: Analytics and reporting
- **Key Features**:
  - Analytics summaries
  - Trend analysis
  - Compliance reporting
  - Performance metrics
  - Data export functionality

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. **Improved Maintainability**

- Each service has a single responsibility
- Easier to locate and fix issues
- Reduced cognitive load when working on specific features

### 2. **Enhanced Testability**

- Services can be tested in isolation
- Mock dependencies more easily
- Better unit test coverage

### 3. **Better Error Handling**

- Centralized error management
- Consistent error types and messages
- Improved debugging capabilities

### 4. **Scalability**

- Services can be enhanced independently
- New features can be added without affecting existing code
- Better separation of concerns

### 5. **Code Reusability**

- Services can be used by different parts of the application
- Shared validation and error handling
- Consistent business logic

## Backward Compatibility

The refactoring maintains complete backward compatibility:

- **Original API**: All existing method signatures are preserved
- **Legacy Wrapper**: The original `biFailureService.ts` now delegates to the new services
- **Import Compatibility**: Existing imports continue to work without changes
- **Hook Compatibility**: The `useBIFailureService` hook maintains the same interface

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Code

No changes required! The refactoring is completely transparent to existing code.

### For New Development

Use the modular services directly for better organization:

```typescript
// Instead of importing from the legacy service
import { BIFailureService } from '../services/biFailureService';

// Import specific services for better organization
import { BIFailureIncidentService } from '../services/bi/failure/BIFailureIncidentService';
import { BIFailureValidationService } from '../services/bi/failure/BIFailureValidationService';
```

### For Testing

Test individual services in isolation:

```typescript
import { BIFailureValidationService } from '../services/bi/failure/BIFailureValidationService';

describe('BIFailureValidationService', () => {
  it('should validate facility ID', () => {
    expect(() => {
      BIFailureValidationService.validateFacilityId('invalid-id');
    }).toThrow();
  });
});
```

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Service-Specific Configuration**

- Each service could have its own configuration file
- Environment-specific settings
- Feature flags for new functionality

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**

- Service-specific error types
- Error recovery strategies
- Automated error reporting

### 3. **Performance Optimizations**

- Caching strategies per service
- Database query optimization
- Connection pooling

### 4. **Monitoring and Observability**

- Service-specific metrics
- Performance monitoring
- Health checks

## Best Practices

### 1. **Service Boundaries**

- Keep services focused on single responsibilities
- Avoid cross-service dependencies
- Use the orchestrator service for complex operations

### 2. **Error Handling**

- Always use the centralized error handler
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Include context for debugging

### 3. **Validation**

- Validate inputs at service boundaries
- Use the validation service for consistency
- Document validation rules

### 4. **Testing**

- Test each service independently
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error scenarios

## Conclusion

The BI Failure Service modularization provides a solid foundation for future development while maintaining complete backward compatibility. The new structure improves maintainability, testability, and scalability while following established patterns in the codebase.
