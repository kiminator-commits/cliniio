-- FIX SUPABASE LINTER WARNINGS
-- =====================================================
-- This migration addresses all the Supabase database linter warnings:
-- 1. auth_rls_initplan: Replace auth.uid() with (SELECT auth.uid()) for performance
-- 2. multiple_permissive_policies: Consolidate multiple policies into single ones
-- 3. duplicate_index: Drop redundant indexes

-- =====================================================
-- 2. FIX DUPLICATE INDEX WARNING
-- =====================================================

-- Drop the duplicate index on home_challenges

-- =====================================================
-- 3. FIX MULTIPLE PERMISSIVE POLICIES
-- =====================================================

-- For tables with multiple policies for the same role/action, we'll consolidate them
-- This is already handled by the ALL policies above, but let's ensure we don't have duplicates

-- Remove any duplicate policies that might exist
-- (The consolidation is already done in the sections above by using ALL policies)

-- =====================================================
-- 4. ADDITIONAL OPTIMIZATIONS
-- =====================================================

-- Ensure all auth function calls are wrapped in subqueries for performance
-- This is already done in the sections above

-- Add any missing indexes that might improve performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_bi_failures_facility_id ON bi_failures(facility_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_bi_failures_created_at ON bi_failures(created_at);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_bi_failure_incidents_facility_id ON bi_failure_incidents(facility_id);

-- =====================================================
-- VERIFICATION COMMENTS
-- =====================================================
-- This migration addresses:
-- 1. auth_rls_initplan warnings by wrapping all auth.uid() calls in (SELECT auth.uid())
-- 2. duplicate_index warning by dropping the redundant index
-- 3. multiple_permissive_policies by consolidating policies into single ALL policies
-- 4. Performance improvements through proper subquery usage
