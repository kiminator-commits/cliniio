# Recently Cleaned Rooms Supabase Integration

This document describes the migration of the Recently Cleaned Rooms dashboard from hardcoded test data to Supabase integration.

## Overview

The Recently Cleaned Rooms dashboard has been successfully migrated from using hardcoded sample data to fetching real data from the Supabase `environmental_cleans_enhanced` table.

## Changes Made

### 1. EnvironmentalCleanService Enhancement

Added a new method `fetchRecentlyCleanedRooms()` to the `EnvironmentalCleanService` class:

```typescript
static async fetchRecentlyCleanedRooms(limit: number = 10): Promise<Array<{
  room: string;
  cleanedAt: string;
  cleanedBy: string;
}>> {
  // Fetches recently completed cleaning records from Supabase
  // Joins with users table to get cleaner names
  // Returns formatted data for the UI
}
```

### 2. New Hook: useRecentlyCleanedRooms

Created a custom hook to manage the recently cleaned rooms data:

```typescript
export function useRecentlyCleanedRooms(
  limit: number = 10
): UseRecentlyCleanedRoomsResult {
  // Manages loading state, error handling, and data fetching
  // Provides refetch functionality for manual refresh
}
```

### 3. Updated Components

#### Environmental Clean RecentlyCleaned Component

- **File**: `src/pages/EnvironmentalClean/components/ui/RecentlyCleaned.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed hardcoded sample data
  - Integrated with `useRecentlyCleanedRooms` hook
  - Added loading and error states
  - Added refresh button functionality

#### General UI RecentlyCleaned Component

- **File**: `src/components/ui/RecentlyCleaned.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed hardcoded sample data
  - Integrated with `useRecentlyCleanedRooms` hook
  - Added loading and error states

## Database Requirements

The integration requires the following database structure:

### Table: `environmental_cleans_enhanced`

- `room_name` - Display name for the room
- `completed_time` - When cleaning was completed
- `cleaner_id` - Foreign key to users table
- `status` - Must be 'completed' for recently cleaned rooms

### Table: `users`

- `id` - Primary key (referenced by cleaner_id)
- `full_name` - Cleaner's full name

### Foreign Key Relationship

```sql
ALTER TABLE environmental_cleans_enhanced
ADD CONSTRAINT environmental_cleans_enhanced_cleaner_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (cleaner_id) REFERENCES users(id);
```

## Environment Variables Required

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to Environmental Clean page
3. Check the "Recently Cleaned Rooms" section
4. Verify data is loading from Supabase (not hardcoded)

### Automated Testing

Run the test script:

```bash
npx tsx src/scripts/testRecentlyCleanedRooms.ts
```

### Playwright Tests

The existing Playwright tests have been updated and are passing:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/cliniio.spec.ts
```

## Features

### Real-time Data

- Fetches actual cleaning records from Supabase
- Shows real cleaner names from users table
- Displays actual completion timestamps

### Loading States

- Shows loading spinner while fetching data
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- Empty state when no recently cleaned rooms exist

### Refresh Functionality

- Manual refresh button in the Environmental Clean version
- Automatic data fetching on component mount
- Configurable limit for number of rooms to display

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive error messages
- Fallback to empty state on errors
- Console logging for debugging

## Migration Benefits

1. **Real Data**: No more hardcoded test data
2. **Scalability**: Can handle any number of cleaning records
3. **Accuracy**: Shows actual cleaning history
4. **Performance**: Efficient database queries with proper indexing
5. **Maintainability**: Centralized data management through Supabase

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Missing VITE_SUPABASE_URL" error**
   - Ensure `.env.local` file exists with correct Supabase URL
   - Restart development server after adding environment variables

2. **"No rooms cleaned recently" message**
   - Check if `environmental_cleans_enhanced` table has records with `status = 'completed'`
   - Verify `completed_time` is not null for these records

3. **"Unknown Cleaner" displayed**
   - Check if `users` table exists and has data
   - Verify foreign key relationship between `cleaner_id` and `users.id`

4. **Loading state never ends**
   - Check Supabase connection and credentials
   - Verify table permissions and RLS policies

### Debug Steps

1. Run the test script: `npx tsx scripts/testRecentlyCleanedRooms.ts`
2. Check browser console for error messages
3. Verify Supabase dashboard for table structure and data
4. Test Supabase connection: `npx tsx scripts/testSupabaseConnection.ts`

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Updates**: Subscribe to Supabase real-time changes
2. **Filtering**: Add filters by date range, cleaner, or room type
3. **Pagination**: Handle large datasets with pagination
4. **Caching**: Implement client-side caching for better performance
5. **Analytics**: Add cleaning frequency and efficiency metrics
