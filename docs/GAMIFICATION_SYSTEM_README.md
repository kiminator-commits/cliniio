## Point Allocation System

### Base Point Calculation

```
Daily Tasks: 10-50 points (core responsibilities)
AI Challenges: 15-500 points (improvement opportunities)
```

### AI Challenge Point Formula

```
Base Points (25) × Difficulty × Impact × Effort × Duration × Skill × Workload
```

#### Multipliers Breakdown

**Difficulty Multipliers**:

- Easy: 1.0x (25 points)
- Medium: 1.5x (38 points)
- Hard: 2.5x (63 points)
- Expert: 4.0x (100 points)

**Impact Multipliers**:

- Low: 0.8x
- Medium: 1.2x
- High: 1.8x
- Critical: 2.5x

**Effort Adjustments**:

- Low: 1.2x (rewards efficiency)
- Medium: 1.0x (standard)
- High: 0.9x (slight penalty)
- Extreme: 0.7x (penalty)

**Additional Factors**:

- Duration: 5 minutes to 8 hours with diminishing returns
- Skill Bonus: Up to 1.5x for skilled staff
- Workload Bonus: 1.3x when workload is low

### Example Point Calculations

**Easy Challenge Example**:

```
"Organize Storage Area" (45 min, medium impact, medium effort)
= 25 × 1.0 × 1.2 × 1.0 × 0.75 × 1.0 × 1.0 = 22.5 → 25 points
```

**Expert Challenge Example**:

```
"Design New Workflow Process" (180 min, critical impact, high effort)
= 25 × 4.0 × 2.5 × 0.9 × 1.5 × 1.2 × 1.0 = 405 → 405 points
```

## Level Progression System

### Enhanced Multi-Dimensional Leveling

The system calculates levels based on multiple factors, not just total points:

**Core Level Formula**:

```
Core Level = Weighted Average of:
- Points (40%)
- Streaks (25%)
- Consistency (20%)
- Mastery (10%)
- Achievements (5%)
```

**Skill-Based Sub-Levels**:

- **Sterilization Level**: Based on sterilization cycle completions and quality
- **Inventory Level**: Based on inventory accuracy and management efficiency
- **Environmental Level**: Based on cleaning quality and compliance
- **Knowledge Level**: Based on learning activities and documentation

### Level Thresholds

- **Level 1-10**: 100 points per level
- **Level 11-25**: 200 points per level
- **Level 26-50**: 300 points per level
- **Level 51+**: 400 points per level

## Streak System

### Current Day Streak

**Purpose**: Track consecutive days of active engagement
**Calculation**: Counts consecutive days with completed tasks
**Exclusions**: Automatically excludes non-working days

### Streak Exclusion Logic

The system automatically excludes days when:

- Office is closed (holidays, weekends)
- Facility is under maintenance
- Custom closure dates are set
- Outside of business hours

### Streak Benefits

- **Consistency Bonus**: Higher points for maintaining streaks
- **Level Acceleration**: Streaks contribute to enhanced leveling
- **Achievement Unlocking**: Streak milestones unlock special achievements

## Leaderboard System

### Overall Facility Leaderboard
