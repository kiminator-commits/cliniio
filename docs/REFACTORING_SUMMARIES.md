## Inventory Service Refactoring

### Overview

The `inventoryService.ts` file has been successfully refactored from a monolithic 626-line service into a modular, maintainable structure.

### Results

- **File Size**: Reduced from 626 lines to 179 lines (71% reduction)
- **Structure**: Modular with separate service classes and utilities
- **Maintainability**: High - clear separation of concerns
- **Reusability**: High - reusable service classes and utilities

### New Structure

```
