# Sterilization Components Refactoring

This document tracks the refactoring work done on the sterilization components to improve code organization, maintainability, and reusability.

## Completed Refactoring

### 1. BiologicalIndicatorTest Component

**Original**: Single 226-line component with mixed concerns
**Refactored**: Decomposed into smaller, focused components

#### New Structure:

```
BiologicalIndicatorTest/
├── index.tsx                    # Main component orchestrator
├── BITestHeader.tsx            # Header with title and close button
├── BITestContent.tsx           # Content section with date/time
├── BITestResultSelector.tsx    # Pass/fail radio button selection
├── BITestWarning.tsx           # Critical alert display
└── BITestActions.tsx           # Submit and cancel buttons
```

**Benefits**:

- Separated UI concerns into focused components
- Improved testability of individual sections
- Better reusability of UI elements
- Cleaner main component logic

### 2. CleaningLogTracker Component

**Original**: 269-line component with complex filtering and display logic
**Refactored**: Extracted reusable sections and improved state management

#### New Structure:

```
CleaningLogTracker/
├── CleaningLogHeader.tsx       # Title and export button
├── CleaningLogFilters.tsx      # Status and date filters
└── CleaningLogStats.tsx        # Summary statistics display
```

#### New Hook:

```
hooks/
└── useCleaningLogTracker.ts    # State management for filters and selection
```

**Benefits**:

- Separated filter logic from display logic
- Reusable filter and stats components
- Better state management with custom hook
- Improved component composition

### 3. ScanInterface Component

**Original**: 177-line component with multiple responsibilities
**Refactored**: Extracted focused UI sections

#### New Structure:

```
ScannerModal/
├── ScanInterfaceHeader.tsx     # Back button and workflow title
├── ScanButton.tsx              # Main scan button with camera/barcode
├── ManualEntrySection.tsx      # Manual barcode input
└── ScanResultDisplay.tsx       # Success/error result display
```

**Benefits**:

- Separated scan interface concerns
- Reusable scan button component
- Better animation handling for manual entry
- Cleaner result display logic

### 4. CleanWorkflow Component

**Original**: 72-line component with mixed UI and business logic
**Refactored**: Separated UI components and business logic

#### New Structure:

```
CleanWorkflow/
├── index.tsx                   # Main component orchestrator
├── CleanWorkflowStatus.tsx     # Status display section
├── CleanWorkflowUpdate.tsx     # Status change notification
├── CleanWorkflowActions.tsx    # Action buttons
└── useCleanWorkflow.ts         # Business logic hook
```

**Benefits**:

- Separated business logic into custom hook
- Reusable UI components
- Better testability of business logic
- Cleaner component composition

## Existing Refactored Components

### PhaseTimer Component

Already refactored into:

```
PhaseTimer/
├── index.tsx                   # Main orchestrator
├── PhaseTimerHeader.tsx        # Header with controls
├── PhaseTimerProgress.tsx      # Progress bar and errors
├── PhaseTimerControls.tsx      # Action buttons
├── PhaseTimerAlerts.tsx        # Warnings and debug info
├── PhaseTimerExpanded.tsx      # Expanded content
├── PhaseToolList.tsx           # Tool list display
└── hooks/
    └── usePhaseTimerState.ts   # State management
```

## Refactoring Patterns Used

### 1. Component Decomposition

- Break large components into smaller, focused components
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Components are composable and reusable

### 2. Custom Hooks

- Extract business logic into custom hooks
- Separate state management from UI rendering
- Improve testability of business logic

### 3. Props Interface Documentation

- Comprehensive JSDoc comments for all interfaces
- Clear documentation of component purposes
- Better developer experience

### 4. Consistent File Structure

- Index files for component orchestration
- Sub-components in dedicated files
- Hooks in separate directories

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused components are easier to understand and modify
2. **Testability**: Individual components and hooks can be tested in isolation
3. **Reusability**: Extracted components can be reused across the application
4. **Readability**: Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to read
5. **Performance**: Smaller components can be optimized individually
6. **Developer Experience**: Better organization and documentation

## Next Steps

Consider refactoring the following components:

- `DirtyWorkflow.tsx` - Apply similar patterns as CleanWorkflow
- `PackagingWorkflow.tsx` - Extract reusable sections
- `ProblemWorkflow.tsx` - Separate UI and business logic
- `DamagedWorkflow.tsx` - Apply component decomposition
- `ImportWorkflow.tsx` - Extract focused components

## Guidelines for Future Refactoring

1. **Component Size**: Keep components under 100 lines when possible
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have one clear purpose
3. **Custom Hooks**: Extract business logic into reusable hooks
4. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive JSDoc comments
5. **Consistency**: Follow established patterns and file structure
6. **Testing**: Ensure refactored components remain testable
